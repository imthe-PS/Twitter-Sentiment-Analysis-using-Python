# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python
The computational process to determine whether the tweet is positive, negative or neutral. Itâ€™s also known as opinion mining, done to know the attitude/emotion of a speaker.

## Steps involved:

-- Extract data from twitter API using the link https://apps.twitter.com/

-- Read the recent tweets based on your requirement or download CSV file using https://www.vicinitas.io/

-- Normalize the tweets from JSON to DataFrame

-- Obtain the sources of tweets

-- Clean the data to extract only Alphabets from the tweets

-- Create the polarity and subjectivity for the cleaned tweets

-- Create a wordcloud to separate normal and racist words

-- Based on polarity separate tweets as positive, negative or neutral

-- Finally based on your requirement plot the graph
