# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python
The computational process of identifying and extracting the subjective information that underlies a text. This can be either a judgement or opinion in a positive, negative or neutral way based on polarity. Itâ€™s also known as 'opinion mining', 'polarity detection'.Sentiment analysis is particularly useful for social media monitoring because it goes beyond the number of likes or retweets, by providing qualitative insights.

## Steps involved:

-- Extract data from twitter API using the link https://apps.twitter.com/

-- Read the recent tweets based on your requirement or download CSV file using https://www.vicinitas.io/

-- Normalize the tweets from JSON to DataFrame

-- Obtain the sources of tweets

-- Clean the data to extract only Alphabets from the tweets

-- Create the polarity and subjectivity for the cleaned tweets

-- Create a wordcloud to separate normal and racist words

-- Based on polarity separate tweets as positive, negative or neutral

-- Finally based on your requirement plot the graph
